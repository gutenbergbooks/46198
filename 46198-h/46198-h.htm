<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Delightfulest-Manager-in-the-World</span>,&mdash;
</p>

<p>I am sending you this play printed instead of
type-written because I think you will find it much easier
to slip into your pocket and read, and also because I
don’t know your address, and printed books have a way
of finding people without being addressed which typescripts
have not yet learnt. So instead of sending my
play round, in what people tell me is the usual way, to
lots and lots of managers in typescript and wasting ever
so much valuable time while they don’t read it, I am
sending it to you direct, and hope you will like it. When
you read it you will find that there is still another reason
why I am glad to see it in print.</p>

<p>First let me have just one word in your ear, please:
don’t look to see how many pages long it is, and (reckoning
“a page a minute”) say it is too short to fill an evening,
for I ought to tell you it is a full-length play but the
printer is war-economising and has printed it all on
fewer pages than he would have done in the days of
Paper, Peace and Plenty long ago.</p>

<p>While I was writing the leading part I pictured one
of our finest actresses in it, and she has read it and says
the play is “simply splendid”: if you want her to take
the part I will tell you her name and address, but she is
such an angel she will forgive you if some one you love
better seems to you to be the heroine.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours sincerely,<br />
<span class="smcap">Marie C. Stopes</span>.

it and weighed it down a bit.</div>

clean, shining blue sea. I’d worked my
hardest in a tiny corner till I had broken
down, in London you know, but I didn’t

H’m. Well. Now lads. On this paper
are the following questions addressed
specially to you as you are between
nineteen and forty-five. Question A.
Have you volunteered for military service
beyond New Zealand as a member of an
Expeditionary Force in connection with
the present war? If so, have you been
accepted for service or rejected?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All Three.</span></div><div class="speech">No. No, Boss. No.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Re. Off.</span></div><div class="speech">Well, Question B. If you have <i>not</i>
volunteered for service, are you, being a
single man without dependants, willing to
become a member of an Expeditionary
Force? or (2) Are you&mdash;? By the way,
let’s settle that first. Are you all single
men?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">All Three.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes. Yes. Yes, sir.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Re. Off.</span></div><div class="speech">Then I needn’t read the alternative

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Re. Off.</span></div><div class="speech">That’s right, lads. Now I’ll be honest
with you, and tell you that all the law
asks of you is to sign copies of this paper
and send them in&mdash;you will get them
officially in a few days maybe&mdash;but that’s
not what <i>I’m</i> here for, to get from you a
mere scrap of paper with a promise for
the future on it. I’m here to get you
yourselves, lads, now. That’s better fitted
to a Briton than to write his name on a
bit of paper, and to go back to his ordinary
job! He that puts his hand to the plough
and turns back&mdash;you know what it says in
the Bible. You lads, and I, have got
acquainted this afternoon, and I know
you’re not <i>that</i> kind.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">No. The germ of everything was in that

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Looking at him as though acquiescing

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Triumphantly.</i>) There <i>are</i> no spirits

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Perhaps the Maoris are right. This <i>was</i>
a spirit. It <i>couldn’t</i> have been imagination!
I heard her speak quite clearly.
Her wonderful voice was like music,
thrilling and deep like the songs of birds
in a cool, deep glade.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">But you were overwrought. Imagination
plays tricks then.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes, I was overwrought. That recruiting
business had amazingly stirred me. But
what she said was so remote from my
misery that I <i>could</i> not have imagined
anything so vital, so full of hope. I felt
shamed, anguished. I felt my manhood
beaten in the dust, by my country, by the
woman I loved.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Murmurs.</i>) No, no.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Do you know what love is? Have you

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Eagerly.</i>) Are you not sure that my love

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">That’s&mdash;that’s not quite what I meant.
But&mdash;when&mdash;when once Nora sees how the
great world honours you for these ideas (<i>taps

must. All women will love you and bless
you&mdash;for you will be the saviour of their

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Looks at her for a moment, then reads.</i>)
“The nations shall unite and have a
super-parliament to which they shall all
send a small number of representatives.
This super-parliament shall make International
laws, but it shall chiefly exist to
prevent any nation flying at another’s
throat. If necessary, by force.” (<i>In
another tone.</i>) Flying at another’s throat,
doesn’t seem formal enough, does it?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Perhaps not. Mark it. Go on.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">“In order to prevent any murderously-minded
nation flying at another’s throat (<i>in

<i>That</i> example will never be forgotten.”</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Never. But go on.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">“In order to prevent for ever,” I’ll add
for ever, shall I?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">“In order for ever to prevent any murderously-minded
nation flying at another’s
throat, or stealing any of the rights, or
breaking any international law, the super-parliament
shall have behind it the whole
of the armaments of the world.” That’s
good, isn’t it? <i>That’s</i> the point.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Splendid! That’s where your scheme
differs from all the dear crack-brained
pacificists. Have you written out the
clauses by which that is secured?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes. (<i>Shuffles the papers.</i>) “The super-parliament
is to have complete control of
all the armies and all the armament
factories in the whole world. Any individual
or group of individuals violating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that monopoly and attempting private
manufacture of armaments shall be subject
to instant death.”</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Good!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">You are bloodthirsty!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">I am only cruel to villains to be kind to
the virtuous. But I’m afraid a really

could mention, would have made armaments
secretly and piled them up.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">No, no, because&mdash;(<i>shuffles the papers</i>.)
Where is it? There is to be a clause
preventing any such hanky-panky.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">There is no doubt, that if that is managed
properly, however greedy or treacherous
any individual nation might be, it simply
wouldn’t <i>dare</i> to go to war.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">That’s the idea.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">And that is a much more practical idea
than that of the pacificists who talk about
<i>voluntary</i> limitation of armaments.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">They idealise human nature.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Now <i>your</i> plan <i>compels</i> decent behaviour.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Well, what you told me of her words then

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Nora, you <i>are</i> a tease! It’s nothing of
the sort, Mr. Varlie. Gordon’s idea is to
have an international parliament, a super-parliament,
and for that to have complete
control of an international army, and also&mdash;what
is very important&mdash;complete control
of all armament making.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Then any nation would have all the rest

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes. That’s where it will get Germany
so splendidly. Germany <i>pretends</i> she
goes in for her militarism only for self-preservation.
Now this international

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Cheerfully.</i>) I’d be taking risks, wouldn’t

a great idea if it’ll kill German militarism!

you were such a top hole genius.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Now you’re laughing, too. None of you

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">How can <i>you</i> think that, Roto? Why,
there used to be war in this very land
between you and the English, and now
there is none.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Roto.</span></div><div class="speech">That’s because the Pakeha are strong.
They make laws we have to obey. If a
Maori kill a Pakeha or a Maori now, the
Maori is hung by the law. So Maori and
Pakeha live without killing.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">But that’s just it! If the International
Parliament was strong and it made laws,
the nations would have to obey and if one
nation went to war and tried to kill another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
that nation would suffer. So the nations
would live without war.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">Germany would never consent.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Then she would openly proclaim that her
militarism is aggressive and not for self-defence.
It would have to be one of the
terms of peace that she did come in.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">Waal, that may not be so easy.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Then all the more need for Gordon’s
scheme. It is the only way to destroy
militarism.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Without some such plan the nations will
all be burdened beyond endurance, with
armament making and the upkeep of
armies.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">And all the lovely face of England will be

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">But I will use the introduction for you,

time to come for a little relaxation.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">Oh, dear lady. I take no relaxation in
these sad times. But I wanted a word
with you before your next Committee for
the relief of the homeless Serbians. As
you know, the American people have been
stirred to the depths, and out of the fulness
of their hearts they have sent <i>me</i> to join
my ministrations with yours. As you well
know, these weeks past I have put my
back into it.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">Very good of you I’m sure. We can’t
have too much help. <i>Practical</i> help.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">At the last Committee Meeting I opined
that a cheque would not be out of place in
your hands, Duchess.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">Never.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Taking out his pocket book.</i>) Waal, my

to me for you. If you could sign the
receipt yourself, Duchess, it would be like
placing seed in fertile ground. I know
your secretary does such routine work for
you, Duchess, and that’s why I took this
chance of handing it to you myself.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">Of course I’ll sign the receipt if you like.
Is that all?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">Waal, the other business will do when we

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Moving off, back of stage.</i>) Then come

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Gratefully.</i>) I <i>say</i>. You do work
miracles.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">It is the Duchess who will do that. Isn’t
she a dear?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">She terrifies me rather.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">For moments, just at times, she terrifies
me. But all the safe times in between I

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">I say, I’m nervous you know.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Oh, <i>don’t</i> be! You will only have a few
minutes this time: just to make a good
impression. If you do that then the
Minister may give you a serious interview
later.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">I’m wretchedly nervous. Is he, is he
<i>short</i> with people?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">He likes people to be short with him! He
is dreadfully bored by long-winded cranks
of course.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">I say, what do you think? (<i>Pulls out
some papers from his pocket.</i>) I thought
of wording Clause 29 of the suggested
constitution as follows: “The Super-Parliament
is to have the power of prohibiting
the manufacture of <i>anything</i>
which in its opinion constitutes a menace
to the Peace of the world: with power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
inflict the death penalty on all concerned
in any infringement of its prohibition in
any country.”</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes. I think that is good. Coupled with
the other clauses that makes it safer.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">I hope the Prime Minister will see that.
I must learn this clause off by heart now.
Teach it to me, will you?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">You don’t know the other clauses off by
heart, <i>do</i> you?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes, of course I learnt them. I couldn’t
<i>read</i> them to the Prime Minister, could I?
And I’m so nervous, I’d muddle them up
unless I just learn them off.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Horrified.</i>) You don’t intend to <i>say off</i>
all the thirty-three clauses of the suggested
constitution to the Prime Minister at this
first meeting, do you?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Simply surprised.</i>) Why, yes! I’m to
tell him the ideas, aren’t I?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Good heavens! not in a block like that
though. After you have made an impression
on him you must give him these
all typed out so that his secretaries
and colleagues and everybody can make
marginal notes on them and hash them up.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">If I’m not to say the clauses I have learnt,
what on earth <i>am</i> I to say?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Say you have an idea worth his serious
attention&mdash;say&mdash;oh&mdash;whatever he makes
you <i>feel</i> will reach his attention!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Good heavens. What a gamble!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Not a bit. The inspiration will come.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech"><i>You</i> have been my inspiration for so much
of this.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">No, no. I have only suggested a word
here and there.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">I owe you so much. How strange it is I
should have met you the same day that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the vision came to me. Next to my
vision-spirit, you are the source of all the
ideas worth anything in it.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Nonsense. Absolute nonsense. I simply
had nothing concrete in my mind at first!
It is you, you, <i>you</i> who have put all the
ideas into practical, living, useful shape.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">But <i>I</i> had no concrete ideas at first!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Well, <i>you</i> evolved them out of your inner
consciousness.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Obstinately.</i>) The vision, and you, gave
me the ideas to work out.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Almost irritably.</i>) It’s sheer <i>nonsense</i>,
that old vision! The thoughts were yours,
yours, <i>yours</i>! She only mumbled a little

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Well, I’m tired of seeing you being so

you are, and how the credit of it is all
your <i>own</i>.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">I do.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Whimsically.</i>) I’m so accustomed to
women thinking poorly of me&mdash;<span class="lock">Nora&mdash;</span></div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>After a pause.</i>) Does she&mdash;does she still

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">No I have waked from my foolish dream
of love for her. She, she was too cruel&mdash;and

loved Robert.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Joy showing in her face, which she tries

Yes, Miss. I’ll dig this pot up for you.</div>



<div class="direction">(<i>He digs with his penknife, all wait breathlessly,

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Eager.</i>) Yes, yes, that <i>is</i> it!</div>

right. You’ve had a narrow escape, sir!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Varlie.</span></div><div class="speech">That don’t amount to shucks! What
does that prove. There is only wild talk.
I tell you I’m known at the American
Embassy, I’m known to the Duchess here.
You can’t begin to prove I ever saw that
green trumpery. The only thing you’ve
got against me is that I wore a false beard!
(<i>Sneers.</i>) Bring that up against an
American citizen and a minister of religion
and you would look queer in the Law

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">And you are known to me&mdash;to us. To
both Mr. Hyde and me. You were Mr.
Varlie in New Zealand.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes, Varlie, there’s no mistaking you!
You bought the freehold of my Station and
all my sheep and I’m not likely to forget
it.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">And you travelled all over New Zealand,
selling things under the name of Varlie,
and you wouldn’t be pretending to be
somebody else and a clergyman too, if you
were honest. Besides (<i>scornfully</i>), I saw
you buy that special secret poison from
Roto, the old Maori, and you made very
special enquiries about its use, too!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Smithers.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>As though recollecting something.</i>)
Varlie&mdash;Varlie&mdash;New Zealand. The
secret service particular warned me against
a man called Varlie who has been hauling
in a lot of freehold in New Zealand under
various names, and travelling for German
American firms. We had lost track of
him. (<i>Joy spreading over his face.</i>) You
don’t mean to say he is John Varlie! Not
John Varlie, Miss?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Yes, yes.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">That’s the name I’ve known him under in
New Zealand for months.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Smithers.</span></div><div class="speech">My, men! We have got a haul. Well,
ladies, the man is safe now, anyway.
There is no need to bother you any more
to-night.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Duchess.</span></div><div class="speech">Cleverness seems to get an appropriately

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Smithers.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Snapping his note book and turning

dangerous man, sir. It is all a pretence

an out and out German, sir, and I make no

attempt on your life, sir. I expect you
have had a narrow escape. We won’t
trouble you any further to-night. Take
him off, men. I’ve got all the addresses.

you. But please give me something to do
at once. What can I do for you?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">Oh, there <i>is</i> one thing you can do for me,
if only you will! Will you!</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Minister.</span></div><div class="speech">An-y-thing you like to ask, my dear, if it
is humanly possible. What is it?</div>

of yours, is he?</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Coming forward.</i>) I have that great
honour, sir.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Gordon.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Takes out sheaf of papers.</i>) If there
was a Super-Parliament constituted as I
suggest Prussian Militarism, all Militarism,
is not only defeated now, but for ever!
It is plucked out by the roots, but not at
the ruinous cost of imposing militarism on
all other nations. Oh, there’s so much.
(<i>Hesitates.</i>)</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Breaking in, her voice almost chanting,
like one inspired, its notes resembling
those used by her at the close of Act I.</i>)
And Militarism is met, not by the weakness
of a too trusting idealism but by force
controlled by intelligence. Law is devised
with behind it international force, which
shall protect the nations, as law backed by
civil force protects each man and woman
in Britain.</div>



<div class="direction">(<i><span class="smcap">Hyde</span> starts, gazing intently at her set inspired

And the nation which
will not come into this council of nations
proclaims itself an outlaw, an aggressor, a
planner of evil, and it inscribes its own
doom, for law that is outraged takes
vengeance implacable.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Loveday.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Holding out her hands to him appealingly.</i>)
You are the most powerful man
in England, it is for you to initiate this
new era, of international safety and peace.
Whatever the terms of an ordinary
peace, militarism will spring up again to
ravage the world. Let Britain lead in
this new enlargement of law and freedom,
for this is the only way to bring <i>security</i>
to the world.</div>

<div class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Minister.</span></div><div class="speech">(<i>Very seriously.</i>) I will think about it,
my dear.</div>

typed out, young man, and bring
it to Downing Street the day after to-morrow.

<h2 class="nobreak">PLAYS OF OLD JAPAN: THE “NŌ”</h2>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">By MARIE C. STOPES and<br />

PROFESSOR JOJI SAKURAI</span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">PREFACE by BARON KATO</span></p>


<p><i>The Times</i> says: “<i>The Sumida River</i> is a little play which, even
in translation, one feels to be of great beauty and intolerable
pathos. Dr. Stopes has written a lucid and serviceable introduction
on the ‘Nō’ plays, which deserve the study of every
student of the drama.”</p>

<p><i>The Morning Post</i> says: “The translators have chosen a rhythmic,
simple, irregular verse, which isolates just that element of pure
tragedy that underlies the native literary crust of ornament....
We are convinced that drawing-room and library will welcome her
to their hearts.”</p>

<p><i>T.P.’s Weekly</i> says: “We advise all who care for the drama to
read this book. The effect may be compared to that of having the
best work of Synge with an added national and religious interest.”</p>

<p><i>The Spectator</i> says: “Dr. Stopes has made the ‘Nō’ and their
history for the first time accessible to the ordinary reader ...
there is pleasure to be got from them even by those who only
read a translation of the poems.”</p>

<p><i>The Times</i> (New York) says: “Dr. Stopes has placed the English
reader under a debt of gratitude by her work on these exquisite
lyric plays.”</p>

<p><i>The Athenæum</i> says: “The author’s vivid and imaginative
sympathy has really enabled her in some degree to communicate
the incommunicable.”</p>

<h2>MAN<br />

<span class="smaller">OTHER POEMS &amp; A PREFACE</span></h2>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="small">BY</span><br />

<span class="smcap">MARIE C. STOPES, D.Sc., Ph.D., F.R.S.L.</span>
Fellow of University College, London.</p>


<p>“The title-poem, wherein is set forth with thoughtful earnestness
and no little grace of language the changing aspects of
man to the eyes of ripening womanhood, and ‘The Brother,’
a ‘true and unvarnished’ tragedy, deriving force from the
very homeliness of its telling, stand out most clearly in a
volume of which the dominating qualities are clearness of
vision and a distinctive point of view.”&mdash;<i>The Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. Stopes</span> is by calling a fossil botanist, and her
scientific training gives restraint and substance to all her
verse. This is particularly noticeable in the longish poem
which opens the book, tracing the changing image which
man assumes in the mind of a growing girl&mdash;a difficult theme
well treated from the personal point of view, and in graceful
measured phrase. But there is no lack of emotion in her
pages; she sings with enthusiasm of the joy of married love;
and sometimes in a minor key of regret for old, dead loves.
Her highest level, we think, is reached in ‘Tokio Snow’&mdash;a
beautiful fancy expressed in stanzas which have a curious
but very successful rhyme-scheme, and ‘Human Love,’ an
impressive moment of spiritual reflection on the theme
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amantium irae</span>.’”&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>
